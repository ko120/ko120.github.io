**Research Interests: LLM, Reinforcemennt Learning, Agent**

Welcome! I’m an M.S. student at the University of Washington working on large language models and reinforcement learning. I previously graduated from Purdue University with **distinction**. I have closely collaborated with Prof. <a href="https://www.huan-zhang.com/">Huan Zhang</a> (UIUC) on the intersection of LLMs and RL, and with Prof. <a href="https://www.davidinouye.com/">David I. Inouye</a> (Purdue) on statistical machine learning.

I was grateful to be selected for NSF-funded summer research program twice, advised by Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sivatheja/">Siva Theja Maguluri</a> (Georgia Tech) and Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/lintan/">Lin Tan</a> (Purdue).

I’m open to collaboration—please email me if you’d like to discuss ideas.

My research interests span across **trustworthy machine learning, large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning**.
