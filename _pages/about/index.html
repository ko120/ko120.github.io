I am a recent graduate in Electrical Engineering from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Class of Spring 2024, with <strong>distinction</strong>. Under the guidance of Prof.<a href="https://www.davidinouye.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">David Inouye</a>, I have cultivated a passion for building <strong>trustworthy machine learning</strong> tools through probabilistic methods.</p> <p>Previously, I was a research intern at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sivatheja/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Siva Theja</a>, focusing on reinforcement learning throughout the NSF-funded summer research program. Furthermore, I was a research intern at Purdue University under the mentorship of Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/lintan/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lin Tan</a>, also as part of an NSF-funded summer research program, focusing on the application of code LLMs to solve the malware authorship problem. My interests span across large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning, driving my ambition to innovate and contribute to the field of machine learning.</p> </body></html>
